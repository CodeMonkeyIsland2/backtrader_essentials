# Introduction: Beyond Single Lines

## Moving Past Single-Value Indicators

In our exploration of technical analysis within Backtrader, we've previously examined indicators that generate a single output stream - such as the Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). These fundamental tools provide valuable insights through their individual data series, accessible via straightforward indexing like `self.sma[0]`.

However, the world of technical analysis extends far beyond single-output indicators. Many sophisticated analytical tools comprise multiple interconnected components that work together to provide a more comprehensive view of market dynamics. Consider indicators such as:

- **MACD System**: Incorporates the main MACD line, a signal line, and a histogram representing their relationship
- **Bollinger Bands**: Features upper, middle, and lower bands that dynamically adjust to market volatility

## Accessing Multi-Component Indicators

Working with these complex indicators requires a different approach to data access. Rather than simple numerical indexing, Backtrader employs **dot notation** combined with predefined line names to access individual components.

For a multi-line indicator instance `self.my_indicator` containing output lines named `line1` and `line2`, you would access their current values as:
- `self.my_indicator.line1[0]` 
- `self.my_indicator.line2[0]`

This structured approach ensures clear, readable code when working with sophisticated analytical tools.

## Chapter Focus

This chapter explores two of the most widely-used multi-component indicators:

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
A sophisticated momentum oscillator that transforms trend-following moving averages into a powerful analytical framework for identifying trend changes and momentum shifts.

### Bollinger Bands
An adaptive volatility indicator that provides dynamic price boundaries, helping traders understand relative price levels and market volatility conditions.

We'll examine their theoretical foundations, practical implementation in Backtrader, proper line access techniques, and demonstrate their integration within a comprehensive trading strategy.

## Key Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:
- How multi-line indicators differ from single-line counterparts
- Proper syntax for accessing individual indicator components
- The mathematical foundations and practical applications of MACD and Bollinger Bands
- Integration techniques for combining multiple indicators within a single strategy
- Best practices for visualizing and interpreting multi-component indicator signals
