# RSI Use Case: Overbought/Oversold Signal Logic

## Implementing Threshold-Based Trading Signals

The most straightforward and widely-adopted RSI application involves monitoring threshold crossings to identify potential overbought and oversold market conditions that may precede price reversals.

## Fundamental Threshold Strategy

### Basic Zone Detection

```python
# Within the next() method of MyRsiStrategy

def next(self):
    # Define standard threshold levels
    rsi_oversold_threshold = 30.0
    rsi_overbought_threshold = 70.0
    
    # Extract current RSI reading
    current_rsi = self.rsi[0]
    
    # Basic threshold monitoring (continuous signals)
    # Note: This approach may generate repeated signals
    # if current_rsi < rsi_oversold_threshold:
    #     self.log(f'RSI ({current_rsi:.2f}) indicates OVERSOLD conditions')
    #     # Exercise caution: RSI may remain oversold for extended periods
    # 
    # elif current_rsi > rsi_overbought_threshold:
    #     self.log(f'RSI ({current_rsi:.2f}) indicates OVERBOUGHT conditions') 
    #     # Exercise caution: RSI may remain overbought for extended periods
```

### Precise Zone Entry Detection

A more sophisticated approach identifies the specific moment RSI crosses into extreme territories, generating discrete signals rather than continuous alerts:

```python
def next(self):
    # Define threshold parameters
    rsi_oversold_threshold = 30.0
    rsi_overbought_threshold = 70.0
    
    current_rsi = self.rsi[0]
    
    # Detect entry into oversold territory
    if (self.rsi[0] < rsi_oversold_threshold and 
        self.rsi[-1] >= rsi_oversold_threshold):
        
        self.log(
            f'OVERSOLD SIGNAL: RSI ({current_rsi:.2f}) '
            f'crossed into oversold zone (< {rsi_oversold_threshold})'
        )
        # Potential buy signal logic
        # Example: self.buy() if not self.position else None
    
    # Detect entry into overbought territory  
    elif (self.rsi[0] > rsi_overbought_threshold and 
          self.rsi[-1] <= rsi_overbought_threshold):
        
        self.log(
            f'OVERBOUGHT SIGNAL: RSI ({current_rsi:.2f}) '
            f'crossed into overbought zone (> {rsi_overbought_threshold})'
        )
        # Potential sell signal logic
        # Example: self.sell() or self.close() if self.position else None
```

## Enhanced Signal Detection: Zone Exit Monitoring

Advanced implementations also track when RSI exits extreme territories, potentially indicating momentum shifts:

```python
def next(self):
    # ... previous threshold definitions ...
    
    # Monitor oversold zone exit (potential trend change confirmation)
    if (self.rsi[0] > rsi_oversold_threshold and 
        self.rsi[-1] <= rsi_oversold_threshold):
        
        self.log(
            f'RECOVERY SIGNAL: RSI ({current_rsi:.2f}) '
            f'exited oversold territory'
        )
        # Potential confirmation for existing long positions
    
    # Monitor overbought zone exit (potential weakness confirmation)
    elif (self.rsi[0] < rsi_overbought_threshold and 
          self.rsi[-1] >= rsi_overbought_threshold):
        
        self.log(
            f'WEAKNESS SIGNAL: RSI ({current_rsi:.2f}) '
            f'exited overbought territory'
        )
        # Potential confirmation for position reduction or exit
```

## Strategic Implementation Considerations

**Signal Timing**: The "zone entry" methodology proves more valuable for generating actionable trading signals, as it identifies precise crossover moments rather than generating repeated alerts while RSI remains within extreme territories.

**Position Management Integration**: Effective RSI strategies often incorporate position status checks (using `self.position`) to avoid duplicate signals or inappropriate trades based on current market exposure.

**Risk Management**: Consider implementing additional filters or confirmation requirements, as RSI can remain in extreme territories longer than anticipated, particularly during strong trending market phases.

## Visual Analysis and Validation

**Dedicated Panel Display**: When executing `cerebro.plot()`, backtrader intelligently displays RSI in a separate panel below the main price chart due to its different value scale (0-100 vs. price levels).

**Threshold Visualization**: The separate panel facilitates easy identification of overbought/oversold crossings by mentally drawing horizontal reference lines at the 70 and 30 levels.

**Correlation Analysis**: The multi-panel layout enables visual correlation between RSI movements and corresponding price action patterns, enhancing pattern recognition skills and strategy validation.

This automatic scaling separation represents a significant convenience feature of backtrader's plotting system, eliminating the need for manual chart configuration.
