# Indicators as Strategy Building Blocks

## The Foundation of Technical Trading Decisions

In the previous chapter, we established our backtrader foundation with data handling and basic backtesting infrastructure. Now we advance to the critical next phase: incorporating logic that drives trading decisions. At the heart of systematic trading lies the sophisticated use of **Technical Indicators**.

Technical indicators represent mathematical computations derived from market data such as price movements, trading volume, and other market metrics. These analytical tools transform complex market behavior into interpretable signals, enabling traders to identify market trends, assess momentum shifts, evaluate volatility patterns, and detect potential price reversals.

## Backtrader's Indicator Architecture

The backtrader framework treats indicators as primary architectural components, not mere supplementary tools. This design philosophy provides several key advantages:

### Core Integration Benefits

**Primary Framework Components**: Indicators exist as essential objects within backtrader's ecosystem, seamlessly integrated with all other framework elements.

**Lines-Based Architecture**: Both indicators and data feeds operate using backtrader's "lines" paradigm. Indicators consume input lines (such as closing price data) and generate output lines (such as moving average values or oscillator readings).

**Intelligent Period Management**: When implementing indicators requiring historical data windows (like a 20-period moving average), backtrader automatically calculates the minimum data requirement (`minperiod`). The framework ensures your strategy's execution logic only begins after sufficient data accumulates for all indicators to produce valid outputs, eliminating data insufficiency errors.

**Modular Composition**: Indicators can process not only raw market data but also outputs from other indicators, enabling sophisticated multi-layered analytical approaches.

**Performance Optimization**: Indicator calculations benefit from backtrader's internal optimizations for computational efficiency.

## Accessing Built-in Indicators

The comprehensive collection of standard technical indicators resides in the `backtrader.indicators` module, commonly imported using the convenient alias `bt.ind` for streamlined code.

This chapter explores two fundamental and widely-utilized indicators that form the foundation of many trading strategies: the **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** for trend analysis and the **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** for momentum assessment. We'll master their implementation, learn to access their computed values, and understand how they generate actionable trading signals.
